                        <p>Little short strokes. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>

                        <p>How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. We'll put a happy little sky in here. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>
                            
                        <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.</p>
                            
                        <blockquote>Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? </blockquote>

                        <p>Let's have a little bit of fun today. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>
                            
                        <p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's have a nice tree right here. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>
                            
                        <p>You need to have a very firm paint to do this. We'll do another happy little painting. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.</p>
                            
                        <p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>
